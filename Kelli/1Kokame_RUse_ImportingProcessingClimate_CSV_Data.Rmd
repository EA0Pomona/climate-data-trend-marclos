## About our station 

Ewa Plantation began in 1890 as a sugarcane plantation mill. Through the 1920s and 1930s, Ewa Plantation was a booming and growing business. Perhaps the plantation began monitoring climate because of climate's impacts on sugarcane, but in any case, they had a climatic dataset beginning in 1905. Currently, sugar plantations in Hawai`i are no longer in operation; therefore, the Ewa Plantation now serves as a historic landmark. However, they continued collecting climatic data even after they were no longer a functioning plantation, collecting data up until the year 2006.  

After downloading their dataset off of NOAA's climate database for the Ewa Plantation station on the island of O`ahu, we inputted it into R for processing. This dataset includes variables like maxmimum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation. This blog will explore trends in temperature and precipitation at this specific station.  

```{r importingCSV}
# Importing Scripts

file = "/home/CAMPUS/kak22013/Climate_Change_Narratives/Kelli/Kokame.csv"

import = read.csv(file)
```
## Let's take a look at our data 
```{r checking}
plot(TMAX~DATE, import)
```

When we first import the data, it is not yet in a form that we can use and visualize well. As you can see, there are several values that don't make sense. How could the maximum temperatures be almost -10000 degrees? It's actually not--the value -9999 is used to represent having no data. We can change these values to "NA" to ensure that the big negative values do not skew our data. 

```{r missings}
import$TMAX[import$TMAX==-9999] = NA
import$TMIN[import$TMIN==-9999] = NA
```

After changing the -9999 values to NA, we can check to see if our data is now usable:

```{r}
plot(TMAX~DATE, import[import$DATE<19131231,], ty='l')
```

Even though we removed the missing values, the data is still unusable. The reason why has to do with how data used to be recorded. Instead of chronologically entering data in a way that Excel could read and turn into a continous timeline, dates used to be inputted in the format of YYYYMMDD. This means that, for example, 19131231 (December 31, 1913) would then turn into 19140101 (January 1, 1914). Chronologically, there are several missing values in between which is why there are so many gaps. The data still needs to be chaned into a form in which dates are continuous and numerically consecutive. In this way, it is true scientists have to manipulate data--but it is not so much the content of the data as the format.  


```{r}
plot(TMAX~DATE, import[import$DATE<19130102,], ty='l')
```

## Fixing the Dates

To get the data to organize like we want, we first need to convert the date to string or character values. After that, we can convert the strings to a data format. 

```{r}
strDates <- as.character(import$DATE)
head(strDates)
import$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%Y%m%d")
```

## Checking the New Dates
```{r}
plot(TMAX~NewDate, import[import$DATE<19130102,], ty='l')
```
## Subset Sites

I have two sites in this data, so, we need to subset it.

```{r}
unique(import$STATION_NAME)
```

Let's choose EWA PLANTATION 741 HI US as the station name...

```{r}
Ewa <- subset(import, STATION_NAME=="EWA PLANTATION 741 HI US", select=c(STATION, STATION_NAME, DATE, NewDate, TMIN, TMAX, PRCP))
```


## The adjusted plot 
```{r}
#plot(TMAX~NewDate, Ewa, ty='l')
Ewa.lm <- lm(TMAX~NewDate, data=Ewa)
#summary(Ewa.lm)
plot(TMAX~NewDate, Ewa, ty='l', xlab = "Year", ylab = "Maximum Temperature (Fahrenheit)")
abline(coef(Ewa.lm), col='red')
summary(Ewa.lm)
```
As shown, the maximum temperature annually has had a slight upward trend from 1905 when the records began until 2006. The slope is about 3.1e-05 (a very tiny slope). This means that, according to the trend, maximum temperatures increase about .000031 degrees per year, or .0031 degrees per century. This increase in maximum temperature is very statistically signficant, with a p-value of 2.2e-16 (a p-value of 0.05 or less would be statistically significant). This means that we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between change in temperature and time. However, we can see that there is a lot of missing data beginning at roughly 1980. While I tried to look into why there were no available measurements for about a 20 year span, no plausible explanations were offered online. 

But since there's a lot of missing data beginning at about 1980, let's focus on the trend from 1905 up until that point to see if the missing data has an effect on the trend slope. 

Here is the graph of maximum temperatures from 1905 up to 1978: 
```{r}
plot(TMAX~NewDate, Ewa[Ewa$DATE< 19780101,], ty='l', xlab="Year", ylab="Maxmimum Temperature (Fahrenheit)")
```


## Evaluating the trend

Now, let us analyze the trend of the maxmimum temperature data from 1905 to 1978.  
```{r}
# Linear Model
EwaMax.lm <- lm(TMAX~NewDate, data=Ewa[Ewa$DATE< 19780101,])
summary(EwaMax.lm)
plot(TMAX~NewDate, Ewa[Ewa$DATE< 19780101,], ty='l', xlab="Year", ylab="Maxmimum Temperature (Fahrenheit)")
abline(coef(EwaMax.lm), col='red')
```

The trend of maxmimum temperatures has a steeper slope of 6.565e-05 when excluding all of the missing data, indicating a .0000656 degree increase each year, or a .00656 degree increase per century. This increase is also statistically significant, with a p-value of 2.2e-16.   

Let's do the same with minimum temperature measurements. 

```{r}
# Linear Model
EwaMin.lm <- lm(TMIN~NewDate, data=Ewa[Ewa$DATE< 19780101,])
summary(EwaMin.lm)
plot(TMIN~NewDate, Ewa[Ewa$DATE< 19780101,], ty='l', xlab="Year", ylab="Minimum Temperature (Fahrenheit)")
abline(coef(EwaMin.lm), col='red')
```


As you can see, minimum temperatures also have an upward trend, with a slope of about 5.8e-05. This translates into a .000058 degree increase per year, or a .0058 degree increase each century. This increase in minimum temperatures is also statistically significant, with a p-value of again 2.2e-16. 


# Looking at individual months

While Hawaii's temperatures are relatively constant year-round, let's still take a look at individual months and their data across different years.

```{r}
# Get months
Ewa$Month = months(Ewa$NewDate) # Creates problems.
Ewa$Month = format(as.Date(Ewa$NewDate), format = "%m")
Ewa$Year = format(Ewa$NewDate, format="%Y")
```

```{r creatingmonthlymeans}
MonthlyMean = aggregate(TMAX ~ Month + Year, Ewa, mean)

MonthlyMean$YEAR = as.numeric(MonthlyMean$Year)
MonthlyMean$MONTH = as.numeric(MonthlyMean$Month)


#Change mean to sd and you'll get standard deviation for each month/year.

#MonthlySD = aggregate(TMAX ~ Month + Year, Ewa, sd)

#MonthlySD$YEAR = as.numeric(MonthlySD$Year)
#MonthlySD$MONTH = as.numeric(MonthlySD$Month)
#MonthlySD$NewDate = MonthlySD$YEAR + (MonthlySD$MONTH - 1)/12

#head(MonthlySD)
```


```{r plottingMonthyMeans}
#plot(MonthlyMean$TMAX, ty='l')
#```

#below is the standard deviation. 


#```{r plottingMonthySD}
#plot(MonthlySD$TMAX, ty='l')

#plot(TMAX~ NewDate, data=MonthlySD, ty='l')
#SD.lm <- lm(TMAX~NewDate, data=MonthlySD)
#summary(SD.lm)

#abline(coef(SD.lm), col="red")

```

### Selecting for 1 Month -- January

Let's now look at the trend of temperatures in January throughout the years. 

```{r January}
#plot(MonthlyMean$TMAX[MonthlyMean$Month=="01"], ty='l')
plot(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMean[MonthlyMean$Month=="01",], ty='l') 
January.lm <- lm(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMean[MonthlyMean$Month=="01",])
summary(January.lm)

abline(coef(January.lm), col="red")

```

Now, the change is `r coef(January.lm)[2]` degress/year or `r round(coef(January.lm)[2]*100, 3)` degress/100 years with a p-value of `r round(summary(January.lm)$coefficients[2,4],4)`. 

### Selecting for 1 Month -- November

Now let's try the same thing with November. 

```{r November}
#plot(MonthlyMean$TMAX[MonthlyMean$Month=="11"], ty='l')
plot(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMean[MonthlyMean$Month=="11",], ty='l') 
November.lm <- lm(TMAX~YEAR, data=MonthlyMean[MonthlyMean$Month=="11",])
summary(November.lm)

abline(coef(November.lm), col="red")

```



Now, the change is `r coef(November.lm)[2]` degress/year or `r round(coef(November.lm)[2]*100, 3)` degress/100 years with a p-value of `r round(summary(November.lm)$coefficients[2,4],4)`. 

## What about for minimum temperatures? 

First we should create monthly mean for each month.

```{r}
MonthlyMeanTMIN = aggregate(TMIN ~ Month + Year, Ewa, mean)

MonthlyMeanTMIN$YEAR = as.numeric(MonthlyMeanTMIN$Year)
head(MonthlyMeanTMIN)
```

Here's a graphic showing the trend of minimum temperatures in November over the years: 

```{r}
#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN, ty='l')

#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="11"], ty='l')

plot(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="11",], ty='l') 
Dec.lm <- lm(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="11",])
summary(Dec.lm)

abline(coef(Dec.lm), col="red")

```


3. In this case, we get a slope, `r coef(Dec.lm)[2]` degress/year and a probability of `r round(summary(Dec.lm)$coefficients[2,4],7)` and an r-sqaured of `r round(summary(Dec.lm)$r.squared, 3)`. As we might expect, the a small amount of the variance is explained by the "Month". Many things predict temerpature, that year is one, is quite problematic.

Let's look at the trends of minimum temperature throughout the years for the month of July. 

```{r}
#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN, ty='l')

#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="07"], ty='l')

plot(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="07",], ty='l', xlab = "Year", ylab = "TMIN") 
July.lm <- lm(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="07",])
summary(July.lm)

abline(coef(July.lm), col="red")

```

The minimum temperatures in the month of July are increasing as well, with a slope of .025. This means that at the current trend, temperatures are increasing at a rate of .025 degrees fahrenheit per year, or 2.5 degrees fahrenheit per century. The understood goal is to keep climate change within 2 degrees celcius or 3.6 degrees fahrenheit above preindustrial levels, and while we can by no means hastily generalize the trends of Ewa Station to the entire globe, this is still a concerning rate. 

# Precipitation 

Here we will try to analyze trends in rainfall at Ewa Plantation throughout the years. 

```{r}
Ewa$PRCP[Ewa$PRCP==-9999] <- NA
PRCP_mean = mean(Ewa$PRCP, na.rm=T)

#plot(PRCP~NewDate, data=Ewa)
#abline(h=PRCP_mean, col="green")

```
```{r}
MonthlyMeanPRCP = aggregate(PRCP ~ Month + Year, Ewa, mean)

MonthlyMeanPRCP$YEAR = as.numeric(MonthlyMeanPRCP$Year)
head(MonthlyMeanPRCP)
```

Let's try looking at trends in precipitation during a specific month. Let's take a look at the month of May. 

```{r}
#plot(MonthlyMeanPRCP$PRCP, ty='l')

#plot(MonthlyMeanPRCP$PRCP[MonthlyMeanPRCP$Month=="05"], ty='p', pch=20, xlab="Year", ylab="Precipitation (Inch)")

plot(PRCP~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanPRCP[MonthlyMeanPRCP$Month=="05",], ty='p', pch=20, xlab="Year", ylab="Precipitation (Inch)")

MayPRCP.lm <- lm(PRCP~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanPRCP[MonthlyMeanPRCP$Month=="05",])
summary(MayPRCP.lm)
abline(coef(MayPRCP.lm), col="blue")
```


```{r}
#MonthlyMeanPRCP = aggregate(PRCP ~ Month + Year, Ewa, mean)

#MonthlyMeanPRCP$YEAR = as.numeric(MonthlyMeanPRCP$Year)
#head(MonthlyMeanPRCP)
#plot(MonthlyMeanPRCP$PRCP, ty='l')
```


## Discussion

While the data at the Ewa Plantation station is incomplete, it does undoubtedly point to a trend that we would expect to come with climate change. Trends for both maximum temperatures and minimum temperatures throughout the years are all increasing--increasing relatively slowly sometimes, but still at a rate fast enough to create significant impacts in the long run. Many of these increasing trends are also statistically significant, meaning that we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the passing time and the temperatures. Also, both months in the summer as well as in the winter see this upward climbing trend.

There are also trends in precipitiation. Though most of the trends in precipitation were not statistically significant, the precipitation in the month of May was statistically significant, and it showed a downward trend of .000656 inches per year, or .0656 inches per century. 

This dataset unfortunately does not include data from the most recent years, so it could be missing trends in temperature caused by increases in carbon dioxide levels since 2006. If the station had included readings from 2015 and onward, we could possibly see the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reaching over 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history.
