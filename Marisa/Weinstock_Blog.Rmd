## Introduction

The Central Valley is a lowland region that extends through central California from the Cascade Mountains in the north to the Tehachapi Mountains in the south. Its 450-mile-long stretch is bounded by the Pacific Coast Range to the west and the Sierra Nevadas to the east. Ranging in width from 30 to 60 miles (78 to 155 kilometers), the Central Valley is divided into two smaller valleys: the Sacramento Valley in the north and San Joaquin Valley in the south. The Central Valley’s fertile soil and extended growing season make it one of the major agricultural regions in the United States (AMNH). The Valley has a hot Mediterranean climate in the north; the southerly parts of the region are dry and categorized as desert. Agriculture is the primary industry in the Central Valley, with its irrigated valleys accounting for a large share of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the United States. The city of Lodi is located just North of Modesto in the Southern San Joaquin County. It is best known for being a center of winegrape production (the “Zinfandel Capital of the World”). Unfortunately, the raising of Lodi’s minimum temperatures for October and September illustrated below signify increasing threats to Lodi’s wine production. Warmer minimum temperatures reduces water supply, reduces the transportation of foliar nitrogen to the riparian agriculture that often grows winegrapes, and damages the balance of winegrape’s flavors.

## Methodology
Station USC00045032 in Lodi, California recorded minimum and maximum temperatures year-round from January 1st, 1893 to January 31st, 1970. This data has been cut to represent January 1st of 1930 to January 31st, 1970 due to a large gap in data. My manipulation of the raw data focuses only on minimum temperature. Specifically, monthly mean temperatures (y-axis) were plotted by years (x-axis). This was done in order to illustrate a particular aspect of climate change’s impact on viticulture. A statistical hypothesis test was performed, which is used to test the validity of a claim that is made about a population. This claim that is on trial, in essence, is called the null hypothesis. This creates a p-value that helps to determine the significance of the results. All hypothesis tests ultimately use a p-value to weigh the strength of the evidence (what the data are telling you about the population). A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis and a large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis. Both September and October have strong evidence rejecting the null hypothesis and therefore illustrate significance minimum temperature changes.  

## Data

### Minimum Temperature Increase in October
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN, ty='p', pch=20)

#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="10"], ty='p', pch=20)

plot(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="10",], ty='p', pch=20) 
Oct.lm <- lm(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="10",])
summary(Oct.lm)

abline(coef(Oct.lm), col="green")

```

The minimum temperatures within the month of October increase at a slope of `r coef(Oct.lm)[2]` degress per year, with a very statistically significant probability  of >.001. This indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

### Minimum Temperature Increase in September
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN, ty='p', pch=20)

#plot(MonthlyMeanTMIN$TMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="09"], ty='p', pch=20)

plot(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="09",], ty='p', pch=20) 
Sep.lm <- lm(TMIN~YEAR, data=MonthlyMeanTMIN[MonthlyMeanTMIN$Month=="09",])
summary(Sep.lm)

abline(coef(Sep.lm), col="purple")

```

The minimum temperatures within the month of September increase at a slope of `r coef(Sep.lm)[2]` degrees per year, with a high statistically significant probability of >.001. This indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

## Lodi's Water Supply

Lodi and the city’s surroundings use groundwater as their main source of water, which is used for residential and irrigational purposes. Anthropogenic warming dries up groundwater reserve and, in conjunction, ground-water pumpage, which greatly exceeds the natural recharge rate, has dramatically altered the ground-water flow in the Central Valley, as well. With significant cuts in managed water allocations in response to the drought, farmers, particularly those in the San Joaquin Valley, are forced to tap heavily into the already heavily depended on groundwater reserves in order to meet irrigation demands. The depletion of groundwater in the Central Valley caused the majority of the major water loss in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins. Between October of 2003 and March of 2010, this showed a loss of 31.0 ± 2.7 mm/yr−1 equivalent in water height, resulting in an overall loss of 30.9 3 km^3^ for the entire study period of 78 months. The Central Valley lost 20.4 ± 3.9 mm/yr−1 of groundwater during the 78-month period, or 20.3 km^3^ in volume. Given the already naturally low rates of groundwater recharge in the San Joaquin Valley and population growth, a continuance of groundwater depletion is expected (Famiglietti, 2011). Lodi’s surrounding San Joaquin Valley relies more heavily on groundwater than its Sacramento counterpart because the drier climate results in more limited natural surface water available. Streamflow within the Central Valley, an important factor in recharging the aquifer system, is influenced by precipitation in the mountains surrounding the valley. Due to the Sierra Nevada experiencing snowpack decline, earlier runoff, and reduced spring and summer streamflows, the Central Valley’s reliance on the already overdrafted groundwater resource furthers (Cayan, 2004). Increased temperature and evapotranspiration will result in increased domestic water use within the city, as well. Through anthropogenic warming, the regional climate of the Central Valley hits extremes, in particular with high extremes during the growing season (White, 2006). This change in the frequency of extreme temperatures has an extreme effect on biological and agricultural systems than changes in mean climate have. As farmers’ irrigation systems are threatened due to a lack of groundwater, soil moisture suffers. The first impact of water deficit is reduced yield, because of a smaller berry size and reduced bud fertility (Leeuwen, 2016). In Mediterranean or other very dry climates, such as the Central Valley and Lodi in particular, quality may also suffer from excessive water stress (Leeuwen, 2016). In addition, soil moisture is an important control for heat and water transfer between the land and atmosphere, which in turn affects the development of extreme heat events (Lobell, 2008). This therefore may worsen climate change.

## Impact on Water Quality

Sea level rise induces intrusion of saline water into the Delta, endangering water supply and agriculture in the reclaimed regions like Lodi that lie west and north west of the Delta region. The protective levees also threaten massive saline flooding with raising sea level (Vanderwarker, 2009). There are various kinds of salinity induced problems in the vineyard. First and foremost is the problem with vine physiology, since excess uptake of certain ions influences the must, and ultimately, the wine. Salinity also increases osmotic pressure, which can affect the vine’s water supply during the dry season because of the high hygroscopicity of salts such as gypsum (“Home”). 
In addition, water quality is endangered by rising temperatures because it affects the salmon population vital to riverside vineyards. Water temperatures provide an important constraint on ecological function, such as fish spawning, swimming performance, metabolism, effects of aquatic invertebrates, and mortality (Wagner, 2011). Within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Chinook salmon are threatened by increased temperatures and drought years (Yates, 2008). These salmon, once in the Mokelumne River, transport biomass and nitrogen; this is key to stream and riparian ecosystem function (Merz, 2006). In fact, the studied native riparian vegetation, including vineyards, in the Mokelumne River that resided close to spawning sites received 18-25% of foliar nitrogen from marine sources (Merz, 2006). With animals feeding on salmon carcasses in the Mokelumne and salmon jawbones scattered in riparian vineyards alongside the river, researchers pointed to salmon as the source for the grape leaves’ total nitrogen. These data suggest that robust salmon runs continue to provide important ecological services with high economic value, even in impaired watersheds. Loss of Pacific salmon can not only negatively affect stream and riparian ecosystem function, but can also affect local economies where agriculture and salmon streams coexist, thereby affecting grape production in particular (Merz, 2006). In addition, even beyond this highly altered river that flow through agricultural areas, salmon also fertilize vineyards in other areas through irrigation water being pumped from spawning rivers (Merz, 2006).

### Diminished Cooling Period

A decline in particularly minimum temperatures puts wine quantity and quality at jeopardy. A rise in minimum temperatures illustrates a rise in temperatures during the night. Unfortunately, wide diurnal temperature swings are key to wine production and quality. The metabolism in grapes run quickly only under the optimal environmental conditions that are now at risk, which require warm dry days and cool nights. Heat of day promotes ripeness and sugar development in the grapes and the cooler nights help the grapes to retain acidity and freshness, resulting in beautifully balanced flavors. To offset the sweetness given off by the warm sun, wines need the acidity metabolized when the cool night slows grape metabolism. This supplies the tangy bite that helps cut the fatty taste when you eat steak. In addition, the brisk weather also promotes anthocyanins, which give wine both its red hue and astringency.
In response to generally increased temperatures and increased prevalence of heat waves, attempts to maintain wine grape productivity and quality in the face of warming may be associated with increased water use for irrigation and the use of misting or sprinkling water in order to cool grapes.

## Conclusion
Lodi’s rise in minimum temperature from 1930 to 1960 is only the beginning of climate change’s effects on the area. Climate change, with its generosity for heat waves, drought, and many other detrimental contributions, builds a stronger and stronger presence within the Central Valley with growing speed. Without mitigating our world’s emission of greenhouse gasses, not only will our wine quality and quantity suffer, but the entirety of the Central Valley, the agricultural hub of our nation, will continue to be increasingly compromised, as well.
