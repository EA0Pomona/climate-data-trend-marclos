# Defining a Project

Climate change science is complex. As a class we have spent six weeks learning how scientists evaluate the earth's climate systems and learned that even determine changes of the Earth's temperature incorporates some uncertainty. 

As a class, we decided to evaluate temperature records for individual locations in the USA and determine if there was a trend. 

## Evaluating Data and Communicating Science

Once we completed this, we researched information from the literature about what were the predicted impacts of climate change on these locations. 

Finally, we combined this information into a series of blogs that might can be used to help understand local and regional climate change implications.
