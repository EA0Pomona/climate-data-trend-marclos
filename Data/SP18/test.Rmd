## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#file="/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/SP18/choi_thurston county_data.csv"
file="/home/CAMPUS/mmc02014/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/SP18/choi_thurston county_data.csv"
import=read.csv(file)

str(import)
#min(import$TMAX, na.rm = T)

strDates <- as.character(import$DATE)
head(strDates)

import$NewDate <- as.Date(strDates, "%m/%d/%Y")

str(import)

```

## Including Plots

Note a very long record... we might need to find a different data set...


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(TMAX ~ NewDate, data=import)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
