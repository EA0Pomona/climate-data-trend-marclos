\subsubsection{Published Blog Grading}

Your final products should include:

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Effectively display climate patterns from NOAA repositories, with at least 6 decades of data. Be sure all graphics are appropriate labeled and have captions that the reader can use to intrepret the data;
  \item Analyze the data using a linear model using R (i.e. lm);
  \item Describe the methods used to obtain and analyze the data; and
  \item Evaluate peer review literature to determine potential regional impacts from climate change -- be sure to include ecological and economic impacts; 
  \item Cite instances of how various scientific arguments have been distorted and politicized;
  \item Identify how conventional scientific standards have been compromised and how arguments that might be based on distortions can be countered.
\end{itemize*}
