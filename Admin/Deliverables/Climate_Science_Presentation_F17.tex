In addition, each team will present (via open-source software, i.e. rPres) their results to the class. The presentation shall include the following:

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Historical development of the field/issue and methods;
  \item summary of IPCC information regarding the topic;
  \item List of researchers that have contributed to this topic in the last 20 years and a description of their contribution; and
  \item Describe existing areas of uncertainty.
\end{itemize*}

Create a presentation as a R Presentation (.Rprs) and it each person should limit their presentation to 10 minutes.Longer presentations will be penalized. Ten minutes goes quickly, so I suggesty you practice a few times to ensure that you don't lose unnecessary points.
