# Climate_Change_Narratives
This is a project for Pomona's Environmental Analysis Course EA030. I designed so students could evaluate the temperature and percipitation changes in a community that is important to them, most likely where they grew up. 

As a project based learning activity, I try to ensure that students:

1. Have a voice in what they decide to pursue;
2. Ensure the project is authentic;
3. Provide a mechanism to make the results public;
4.
