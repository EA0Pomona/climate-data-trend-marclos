# Climate_Change_Narratives -- Read this First
This is a project for Pomona's Environmental Analysis Course EA030. I designed so students could evaluate the temperature and percipitation changes in a community that is important to them, most likely where they grew up. 

As a project based learning activity, I try to ensure that students:

1. Have a voice in what they decide to pursue;
2. Ensure the project is authentic;
3. Provide a mechanism to make the results public;
4. 

## Resources to needed for collaborators

1. Github account (free and if associated with a teaching institution free access to private accounts too.);
2. R program;
3. Access to Rstudio Server OR desktop Rstudio;
4. Some basic understanding of R and LaTeX.

## Collaborator Best Practices

1. Pull each time you begin to work on various resources
2. Push each time you make changes
3. Check milestones and issues each session 

## Note on Pushing

To push you need to get a ssh key. It took me hours to figure out this, but you have to work within both Rstudio AND Github to get the key and then copy it into the other, I can't remember the order, so if you figure it out, write it down and enter it here!
