# Climate_Change_Narratives -- Read this First
This is a project for Pomona's Environmental Analysis Course EA030. I designed so students could evaluate the temperature and percipitation changes in a community that is important to them, most likely where they grew up. 

As a project based learning activity, I try to ensure that students:

1. Have a voice in what they decide to pursue;
2. Ensure the project is authentic;
3. Provide a mechanism to make the results public; and
4. Align with course goals

## Resources to needed for collaborators

1. Github account (free and if associated with a teaching institution free access to private accounts too.);
2. R program;
3. Access to Rstudio Server OR desktop Rstudio;
 - In addition, several R packages and libraries need to be installed: shiny, etc.
4. Some basic understanding of R and LaTeX.

## Collaborator Best Practices

1. Pull each time you begin to work on various resources;
2. Commit several times per hour (like saving in Word...) and add a comment that describes what you accomplished (This is for others, and yourself if you have a memory like mine.);
3. Push each time you make changes; and
4. Check milestones and issues each session.
5. Do not push large file into Github, you may need to add them to the .ignore file.

## Note on Pushing

To push you need to get a ssh key. It took me hours to figure out this, but you have to work within both Rstudio AND Github, see http://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/ before proceeding.

1. Create a project in Rstudio; 
2. Generate a ssh key in Rstudio (Global Options)
3. Copy the ssh key and paste into Github (profile/key)
4. Push...

Note: This is from memory and needs some serious editing.
